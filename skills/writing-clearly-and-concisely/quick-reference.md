# Elements of Style - Quick Reference

**Core Principle**: Write clearly. Cut ruthlessly. Every word must earn its place.

## Grammar & Punctuation (Rules 1-7)

1. **Possessive 's**: Charles's, Burns's
2. **Series comma**: red, white, and blue
3. **Parenthetic commas**: Use both or neither
4. **Comma + conjunction**: "X is true, but Y is also true"
5. **No comma splice**: Use semicolon or period between independent clauses
6. **No fragments**: Complete sentences only
7. **Participial subjects**: "Walking down the road, HE saw..." (not "...a house appeared")

## Composition (Rules 8-18)

8. **One topic per paragraph**
9. **Topic sentence first**
10. **Active voice**: "I did X" not "X was done by me"
11. **Positive form**: "He forgot" not "He did not remember"
12. **Concrete language**: "It rained" not "Bad weather occurred"
13. **Omit needless words**: "whether" not "the question as to whether"
14. **Vary sentence structure**
15. **Parallel form**: Keep similar ideas in similar structure
16. **Related words together**: "He found only two" not "He only found two"
17. **One tense in summaries**
18. **Emphatic words at end**: Save the punch for last

## Quick Wins for Technical Writing

- **Active voice**: "The system launches" not "is launched"
- **Positive phrasing**: "Missing file: x.conf" not "File not found"
- **Cut filler**: Delete "in order to", "the fact that", "in many cases"
- **Be specific**: "40% faster" not "performance improvements"
- **Commit messages**: Action verbs, no passive voice

## Common Mistakes

- less/fewer: less time, fewer bugs
- effect/affect: effect (noun/result), affect (verb/influence)
- data is plural: "data are" not "data is"
- like/as: "as I said" not "like I said"
- literally ≠ figuratively
